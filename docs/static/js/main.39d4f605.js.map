Raising your kitten well and providing a healthy and stimulating environment, \r\n          as well as vetrinary care, is critically important. The first few days in a kittens new home can be both exciting and daunting, \r\n          below are some things you can do to prepare for your kittens arrival.</p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Have at least one clean litter box ready. Many cats will not use a box that is already claimed by another animal, \r\n            if you have more than one cat in your family its best to have at least one for each.</li>\r\n            <li>Have fresh food and clean water available at all times in a location that is easy for your kitten to get to. \r\n            It's a common misconception that cats will overeat to their detriment, unless you have a cat that is overweight \r\n            or under the care of a veterinarian its best to have fresh food and water always available.</li>\r\n            <li>Kittens love to play! Having a scratching post ready and a few toys will ensure your kitten expresses this energy in appropriate ways.</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default NewKitten;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/components/newKitten.js\n **/","import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport Nat1 from '../assets/images/Nat1.jpg'\r\nimport Nat2 from '../assets/images/Nat2.jpg'\r\nimport Nat3 from '../assets/images/Nat3.jpg'\r\nimport Nat4 from '../assets/images/Nat4.jpg'\r\nimport Nat5 from '../assets/images/Nat5.jpg'\r\nimport Nat6 from '../assets/images/Nat6.jpg'\r\nimport Nat7 from '../assets/images/Nat7.jpg'\r\nimport Nat8 from '../assets/images/Nat8.jpg'\r\nimport Nat9 from '../assets/images/Nat9.jpg'\r\nimport Nat10 from '../assets/images/Nat10.jpg'\r\nimport Nat11 from '../assets/images/Nat11.jpg'\r\nimport Nat12 from '../assets/images/Nat12.jpg'\r\nimport '../style.css';\r\n\r\nclass PhotoGrid extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"w3-row-padding\">\r\n        <div className=\"w3-half\">\r\n          <img src={Nat1} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n          <img src={Nat2} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n          <img src={Nat3} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n          <img src={Nat4} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n        </div>\r\n         <div className=\"w3-half\">\r\n          <img src={Nat7} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n          <img src={Nat8} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n          <img src={Nat9} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n          <img src={Nat10} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n          <img src={Nat11} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n          <img src={Nat12} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n          <img src={Nat5} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n          <img src={Nat6} role=\"presentation\" style={{width:'100%'}}></img>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default PhotoGrid;\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/components/photoGrid.js\n **/","import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport Amelia1 from '../assets/images/Amelia1.jpg'\r\nimport NatAndAmelia1 from '../assets/images/NatAndAmelia1.jpg'\r\n\r\nclass Queens extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"w3-row-padding\">\r\n        <div className=\"w3-half\">\r\n          <img src={Amelia1} role=\"presentation\" className=\"pictureLeftColumn\"></img>\r\n          <img src={NatAndAmelia1} role=\"presentation\" className=\"pictureLeftColumn\"></img>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"w3-half\">\r\n          <div className=\"fancyHeading\">Amelia Mauheart</div>\r\n          <p>Amelia Mauheart is a one of a kind mau.
